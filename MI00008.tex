\section{Establishment And Solution For Problem One}
\subsection{Selection of Indicators}
The early-warning mechanism of social security and stability refers to the critical state that signals the operation of society and shows that disorderly phenomena have taken place or are about to take place, a set of systems and methods aimed at attracting the attention of policy makers, managers and the public, analyzing the causes in a timely manner, and implementing effective measures so as to prevent the undesirable phenomena of social operation from further worsening. In the face of the rapid development of modern society, it will be helpful for government decision-making departments and public security organs to establish a complete and effective early-warning mechanism for social security and stability, guan took timely and effective preventive measures against risks in social development in order to maintain and promote social harmony and stability.

Social security is a more complex concept, and due to the broad nature of its content, there is a distinction between broad and narrow senses. Social security in the broadest sense refers to the state of social operation in which the entire social system can maintain benign operation and coordinated development, and the insecurity factors and influence are minimized. Obviously, social security includes economic security, political security, social life security, ideological and cultural security, and many other aspects. Social security in the narrow sense refers to security in areas other than economic and political systems. Based on the analysis of the above two aspects, we believe that the connotation of social security can be interpreted as: Social security refers to the security of the public living space of the population, which includes the security of citizens' lives and property, the order of social life, and the ecological environment, and it directly reflects the needs of public security interests closely related to citizens.

We believe that there is no absolute objectivity and reasonableness in the selection of indicators, of course, we cannot guarantee that the indicators we choose will be reasonable, but we read a lot of literature to ensure that our indicators are as objective and reasonable as possible within our ability.

Social stability includes political stability, economic stability, normal social order and people's peace of mind. These aspects are interrelated, mutually influencing, interacting and inseparable. Political stability is the core of social stability as a whole, economic stability is the foundation of social stability as a whole, normal social order is a necessary condition for political stability and economic stability, and people's peace of mind is a comprehensive reflection of social stability. We divide the indicators into three categories, police source indicators, warning indicators and alarm indicators. According to the analytic hierarchy method, the indicator system is divided into target layer($A_i$), criterion layer($A_{ij}$) and indicator layer($A_{ijk}$). The specific meaning of each of these indicators is listed in the Appendix A.

We have included our indicators in the following figure:

\subsection{Establishment of ISM Model}
ISM (Interpretive Structural Modeling) is a model that is developed to study complex systems. 
Based on tools such as directed graph, matrix and computer technology, a multi-level 
hierarchical structure model is constructed (POLAT \& RMAC, 2011, p. 169-174). DEMATEL 
(Decision Making Trial and Evaluation Lab), which is a scientific method based on graph theory 
and matrix to simplify the complex system structure (Gu Xuesong \& Chi Guotai, 2010, p. 508-
514). The combined model in this paper integrates the centrality and causation of DEMATEL 
into the multi-level hierarchical structure of ISM, which can not only clarify the hierarchical 
relationship of various influencing factors but also study the relative importance of constraints, 
so as to make the analysis result more objective and reasonable.
The steps to build the composite model are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
    \renewcommand{\labelenumi}{\textbf{Step \theenumi}}
    \item Determine the set of influencing factors :
\begin{equation}
A=\{a_i|i=1,2,\cdots ,n\}
\end{equation}
    \item Determine the factor influence scale, and determine the mutual influence relationship between 
the factors through expert knowledge and experience, and get the direct influence matrix $V$.
\begin{equation}
    V=[v_{ij}]_{n\times n}
\end{equation}
Thereinto, $v_{ij}$ represents the influence degree of factor $a_i$ on factor $a_j$. When $i=j$ , $v_{ij}=0$.
    \item  Calculate the direct impact matrix $V$ to obtain the normalized direct impact matrix $X$ :
    \begin{equation}
X=[X_{ij}]_{n\times n}=\frac{V}{\max \sum_{j=1}^{n}V_{ij}}
\end{equation}
    \item Calculate the comprehensive impact matrix $T$ :
\begin{equation}
T=[T_{ij}]_{n\times n}=X(I-X)^{-1}
\end{equation}
Thereinto, $I$ is identity matrix.
    \item The influence degree $f_i$ , the influence degree $e_i$ , the center degree $z_i$ and the reason degree $y_i$ of 
the constraint factors were calculated. The calculation formula is as follows:
\begin{eqnarray}
    &f_i=\sum_{j=1}^{n}T_{ij},1\le i\le n \\
    &e_i=\sum_{j=1}^{n}T_{ij},1\le i\le n\\ 
    &z_i=f_i+e_i\\
    &y_i=f_i-e_i
\end{eqnarray}
    \item Draw the cause and result diagram:

Cartesian coordinate system is drawn with the degree of center as the abscissa and the degree of 
cause as the ordinate.
    \item  Calculate the overall impact matrix $H$ :
    \begin{equation}
        H=[H_{ij}]_{n\times n}=T+I
    \end{equation}
    \item Determine the threshold value $\lambda$ (Xue Wei1 \& Geng Zhiwei, et al. 2019, p. 99-104.):
\begin{equation}
    \lambda =\alpha +\beta
\end{equation}
Where, and respectively refer to the mean value and standard deviation of the comprehensive 
influence matrix $T$ .Different $\lambda$ values have different logical relationships with the 
influencing factors (Sun Jing, 2018). The choice of $\lambda$ is more subjective based on expert 
experience, while replacing it with the sum of the mean and standard deviation based on the 
statistical distribution is more objective, which can reduce the influence of subjectivity.
    \item Calculate the standardized reachable matrix $K$ :
\begin{equation}
    K=[K_{ij}]_{n\times n}
\end{equation}
Thereinto, if $H_{ij}>\lambda$ ,then $H_{ij}=1$ 

\hspace{4.5em} if $H_{ij}\le \lambda$ ,then $H_{ij}=0$ .
\item  According to the reachability matrix, the reachability set $R_i$ and antecedent set $S_i$ of each 
influencing factor are determined.\\ 
Thereinto, $R_i$ is composed of the index set corresponding to all the 
columns with index 1 in the ith row of the reachable matrix

\hspace{4.5em} $S_i$ consists of the set of indices 
corresponding to all rows with index 1 in the ith column of the reachable matrix.
\item Verify:
\begin{equation}
    R_i=R_i\cap S_i,(i=1,2,\cdots ,n)
\end{equation}
If it is true, then $a_i$ is the highest level factor. At this time, row $i$ and column $i$ are deleted in $K$ , 
and the calculation is repeated until all factors are deleted.
\item Draw the hierarchical structure diagram of factors according to the order of factors to be 
deleted, and establish the structural model.
\end{enumerate}

In 1970s, the famous computer scientist Donald Knuth first came out with a typesetting program, which named \TeX\ \ldots
